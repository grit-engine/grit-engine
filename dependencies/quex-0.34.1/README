BRIEF:

   Quex is a  generator for lexical analysers with  extended features, such as
   event handling  for mode transitions, mode inheritance  and the indentation
   event. Quex comes with an extensive documentation in pdf format located in
   the ./DOC subdirectory. Note, that not all distributions of quex contain
   the documentation. It is always available on the web under quex.sf.net. The
   ./demo subdirectory  contains examples  that should get you quickly up and
   running.

NOTE: Quex requires python to be installed. 

INSTALLATION:

  The installation process is simple:

  -- Extract  the file  'quex-x.x.x.tar.gz' into  a directory  that  fits your
     little heart's desires.

  -- Set the  environment variable 'QUEX_PATH'  in your system  environment to
     the place  where you installed quex. If  you are using a  Unix system and
     the bash-shell, and your are user 'elvis' then add something like the 
     following line to your .bashrc-file:

         export QUEX_PATH=/home/elvis/downloads/quex-0.11.2/

     provided that you extracted the files into the directory /downloads/quex-0.11.2

  -- Make a link from the file $QUEX_PATH/quex-exe.py to $EXE_PATH/quex where
     $EXEC_PATH is a path where executables can be found by your system.
     If you work on a unix system, you might want to type

        > ln -s /home/elvis/downloads/quex-0.11.2/quex-exe.py \
                /home/elvis/bin/quex
     
     In order to create a private directory where your system finds executable
     files add the directory '/home/elvis/bin' to your path. Under Unix with a 
     bash shell, you need to append

        export PATH=/home/elvis/bin:$PATH

     to your .bashrc file in your /home/elvis directory.  You might want to
     ensure executable rights with
 
        > chmod a+rx /home/elvis/downloads/quex-0.11.2/quex-exe.py
        > chmod a+rx /home/elvis/bin/quex

  -- Supply your c++ compiler with the include path '$QUEX_PATH/code_base'. If
     you are using g++ simply add the option

         -I$(QUEX_PATH)/code_base 

     to the  list of compiler flags. In the subdirectory ./demo you find a list
     of examples that have ready-to-rumble makefiles. You may use these 
     to startup your project.


CONTACT:

     Please, send feedback! Any bug you find is likely to result in a unit test
     that is executed at any build. Thus, providing bug reports is an essential
     support to the stability and quality of the software. If you are using
     quex for a famous software project or you just think that quex is just
     marvelous, then it also helps if you send me your inputs. Such support
     encourages me to work on it harder and more often ...

     Please, feel free to send me any coments, critiques or suggestions to

     fschaef@users.sourceforge.net.
