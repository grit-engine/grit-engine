 * General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the
 * years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the
 * equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being
 * at rest in a gravitational field (for example when standing on the surface of
 * the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is
 * inertial motion: In other words an object in free fall is falling because that
 * is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of
 * this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics.
 * This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because
 * in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to
 * each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty
 * Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. In 1915, he devised the
 * Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the
 * mass, energy, and momentum within it.                                          */
