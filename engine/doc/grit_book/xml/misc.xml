    <section title="Lua" id="lua">

        Lua is a general purpose scripting language. It is well-known for
        having a small and fast implementation but a wide set of features
        including co-operative threading (co-routines), closures, "self"-style
        object orientation, and so on. Lua is more expressive and faster than
        all of the mainstream scripting languages and is used in many computer
        games.

        To learn Lua quickly, read chapter 2 of <web
        url="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/">its manual</web>.

        Lua is used in Grit with some minor modifications that make Lua code
        written for Grit incompatible with a regular Lua interpreter and
        regular Lua programs potentially incompatible with Grit.  This is done
        for performance and usability.

        It should be possible to make regular Lua code work in Grit with
        minor (probably zero) modifications and the same performance. It is
        very unlikely that Grit Lua code will work outside of the
        customized Grit Lua VM without running much more slowly.

        This section details the Lua modifications.  You can skim it if you are
        not already very familiar with Lua, and if you're not intending to port
        Lua code from external sources to run in Grit.

        <section title="Relative Path Literals" id="lua_paths">

            It is convenient for Lua files to refer to resources via relative
            paths.  This makes it possible to define packages of scripts and
            resources, that can be downloaded and unpacked anywhere in the
            directory hierarchy without having to edit the Lua files to correct
            absolute paths.

            However, when using strings to represent relative paths, the
            strings can be passed by value through function calls and variable
            assignments and end up being used in a different Lua file, where
            the relative path no-longer resolved correctly.

            In order for the relative paths to be resolved in the file where
            they are defined, Lua has been extended to add another kind of
            string literal:

            <lua>
                print(`foo`)
                print(`/dir/foo`)
                print(`../foo`)
                print(`.`)
            </lua>

            This string is assumed to be a path.  If the path begins with a '/'
            then it behaves the same as ordinary strings.  However other paths
            are assumed to be relative, and will be resolved using the
            directory of the currently-executing Lua file (or / if such a dir
            cannot be found).

            The path will also be canonicalised, i.e., use of . and .. will be
            removed.  An error is raised if too many .. descend below the root
            of the game directory.

            <lua>
                assert(`foo/../bar` == `bar`)
                assert(`foo/../bar/.` == `bar`)
                assert(`./foo/../bar` == `bar`)
                assert(`/.` == `/`)
            </lua>

        </section>

        <section title="Unicode" id="lua_unicode">

            All Lua files are now UTF-8. The string class in Lua has been
            rewritten to properly understand unicode. E.g. #"£" is 1, not
            2. The most visible difference is that the syntax for regular
            expressions has changed. The new syntax is that of <web
            url="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp">ICU's
            regular expression engine</web>. For documentation, see
            sections "Regular Expression Metacharacters", "Regular
            Expression Operators" and "Replacement Text".

        <section title="Vectors &amp; Quaternions" id="lua_vectors">

            Grit Lua scripts are often used to transform and manipulate objects
            in screen space and 3D space, as well as to manipulate colours.
            This is easiest with primitive vector (2d, 3d, 4d) and quaternion
            values.  For performance reasons, we cannot use userdata or tables
            for our vector and quaternion values.  This puts too much pressure
            on the garbage collector.  Thus, the VM has been modified so that
            vector2,3,4, and quat are primitive types just like 'number',
            'boolean' and 'nil'. They are copied by value and are not garbage
            collected.  The following code shows some of the ways they can be
            used:

            <lua>
                Q_ID = quat(1, 0, 0, 0)      -- constructing quaternions and 3d vectors
                V_ID = vec(0, 0, 0)
                V_NORTH = vec(0, 1, 0)
                V_EAST  = vec(1, 0, 0)

                local v = vec(1, 2, 3)
                print(v)
                print(v + v)
                print(2 * v)
                print(v * 2)
                print(v / 2)
                print(v * v)                   -- pointwise multiplication
                print(dot(v, v))               -- dot product
                print(norm(v))                 -- normalise
                print(cross(V_NORTH, V_EAST))  -- cross product
                print(-v)                      -- opposite direction, same length

                print(Q_ID)

                print(Q_ID * v2)               -- transform a vector

                local q2 = quat(180, vector3(0, 0, 1))  -- angle/axis form
                print(q2)
                print(q2 * v2)  -- transform a vector by a quaternion

                local q3 = Q_ID * q2 -- concatenate quaternion transformations
                print(q3)
                print(q3 * v2)
                print(inv(q3) * q3 * v2)  -- invert a quaternion

                print(v2 == v2)  -- equality is pointwise on the elements
                print(q2 == q2)
                print(q2 ~= q3)

                print(#v2) -- length (pythagoras)
                print(#q2) -- length (should be 1 for quaternions used to represent rotations)

                print(unpack(v2)) -- explode into x, y, z
                print(unpack(q2)) -- explode into w, x, y, z

                print(quat(90, vector3(0,0,1)) * (V_NORTH + V_EAST)) -- angle/axis constructor form
                print(quat(V_NORTH, V_EAST))                         -- quat between two direction vectors
                print(quat(V_NORTH, V_EAST) * V_NORTH)

                print(V_NORTH.yx) -- arbitrary swizzling is supported
            </lua>

        </section>

        <section title="Not A Number (NaN)" id="lua_nan">

            If you divide by zero in regular lua, you get a NaN value that goes
            on to pollute other values, until it eventually causes a problem in
            an unrelated area of code.  This makes debugging difficult because
            it is hard to find the original cause of the NaN. In Grit we
            instead trap the divide by zero with an error instead of returning
            NaN.

        </section>

        <section title="Tail Call Optimisations" id="lua_tco">

            If the last statement of a Lua function is a call to another
            function (a <def>tail call</def>), the standard Lua compiler will
            perform an optimisation that results in a small performance
            improvement and allows unbounded tail call recursion (essentially
            allowing more programs to be written).  Simply put, the interpreter
            re-uses the existing stack frame for the new call, which avoids
            using too many stack frames and therefore using too much memory.
            Here is an example of such a program:

            <lua>
                function sum_1_to_n(x, sum)
                    if x == 0 then return sum end
                    sum = sum or 0
                    return sum_1_to_n(x-1, sum+x)
                end
            </lua>

            Note that it is only a single class of recursive functions that can
            benefit from tail call optimisation.  The following code implements
            the same function, using regular recursion.  This code will create
            too many stack frames if given a high x input, as the tail call
            optimisation cannot be applied.

            <lua>
                function sum_1_to_n(x)
                    if x == 0 then return 0 end
                    return x + sum_1_to_n(x-1)
                end
            </lua>

            Tail call optimisation removes stack frames, and thus removes lines
            from the stack trace if an error is generated.  This can be highly
            confusing when debugging programs, as you can't find the line
            number where the bad call occurred.

            It is not only in the case of these "tail recursive" functions
            where the loss of stack frame occurs, but in any function with a
            tail call.  In almost all such cases the optimization does not
            provide any benefit at all.

            We consider the small overall benefit of this feature to be a poor
            tradeoff for the productivity loss caused its effect on the
            readability of stack traces.  Consequently, <def>it is
            disabled</def> in Grit.  This means programs like the above must be
            rewritten as follows, to avoid using too many stack frames:

            <lua>
                function sum_1_to_n(x)
                    local counter
                    for i=1, x do
                        counter = counter + i
                    end
                    return counter
                end
            </lua>

            For an example of where lost debugging information causes a
            problem, see the following code, where the stack trace does not
            mention the critical filename or line number where the function was
            wrongly called.  Imagine that there are many calls to
            do_something_tricky all over the program, and the arguments to the
            call are computed in each case.  This means the stack trace is
            extremely useful for finding out exactly what went wrong, but the
            crucial stack frame is lost.

            <lua>
                function do_something_tricky(x, y)
                    if x ~= y % 3 then
                        error "You fool, you called do_something_tricky wrongly."
                    end
                end

                function i_am_buried_somewhere_in_a_million_lines_of_code ()
                    x = 42
                    y = 666
                    return do_something_tricky(x, y) -- problem is here
                end
            </lua>

        <section title="Quaternion Basics" id="maths_quaternion">

            Quaternions are used to represent rotations in 3d space. They may seem scary, especially if you read <web
            url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation">wikipedia articles</web> on the subject.
            The maths behind them is advanced, but you don't need to understand that in order to use them in Grit.

            Quaternions are just a clockwise rotation of a given number of degrees about a given axis (think like
            screwing in a screw). Part of the reason they seem scary is that they are often given in 'raw' form like so:

            <lua>
                quat(1,0,0,0)
            </lua>

            These 4 floating point numbers are the in-memory representation of the rotation.  They are labeled
            <def>w</def>, <def>x</def>, <def>y</def>, <def>z</def>, in that order.  The fact that only 4 numbers are
            needed is the reason quaternions are popular.  The most reasonable alternative, rotation matrixes, require 9
            numbers.  This particular quaternion is very important, as it is the <def>identity quaternion</def>.  It
            represents a rotation of 0 degrees.  When writing Lua code you can use the <def>Q_ID</def> global variable
            to make this more explicit.

            It is possible to understand raw quaternions if you are reasonably good at mathematics, but it is much
            clearer to give quaternions in their angle/axis form. Here is the same quaternion in angle/axis form (you
            can choose any axis, since it is 0 degrees of rotation).  These quaternion values all test equal:

            <lua>
                quat(0, vec(0,0,1)) == Q_ID
                quat(0, vec(1,0,0)) == Q_ID
            </lua>

            A rotation of 0 degrees about any axis is not very useful. The following is a more interesting quaternion:

            <lua>
                quat(90, vec(1,0,0))
            </lua>

            This means a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees about the 'X' axis.  To visualise this, imagine screwing a
            screw in the direction of the X axis. If you turn the screw 90 degrees, what used to point in the direction
            of the Y axis now points towards the Z axis. Likewise, what used to point in -Z now points towards Y.

            To specify an anti-clockwise rotation about the X axis, one can invert either the angle or the axis.
            Inverting both results in an identical quaternion.  The following are all equal:

            <lua>
                quat(-90, vec(1,0,0))
                quat(90, vec(-1,0,0))
                quat(0.7071068, -0.7071068, 0, 0)
            </lua>

            Generally, if you see a quaternion with 0.7 in the first value, it is a rotation by 90 degrees, whereas 0
            indicates 180 degrees.  In both cases, the last 3 numbers taken as a vector3 give the axis of rotation.
            Here are some example of 180 degree rotations:

            <lua>
                quat(0, 1, 0, 0) -- 180 degrees about X
                quat(0, 0, 1, 0) -- 180 degrees about Y
                quat(0, 0, 0, 1) -- 180 degrees about Z
            </lua>

            Note that there are many different ways of rotating by 180 degrees.  E.g. a barrel roll, turning on the
            spot, and doing a backflip. You can in fact rotate by 180 degrees about any axis and the result is different
            in each case.  On the other hand if you rotate by 0 degrees than it does not matter which axis you rotate
            around, because you are not rotating at all.

            You can also get the quaternion that would transform one vector into another: The following quaternions all
            specify a rotation of 90 degrees about the 'X' axis.  In the first case Y is turned to Z, and in the second
            case -Z is turned to X.

            <lua>
                quat(vec(0,1,0), vec(0,0,1))
                quat(vec(0,0,-1), vec(0,1,0))
            </lua>

            It is possible to see the raw form of a quaternion by typing these other forms into the console.  Also, one
            can easily extract the axis and angle from a quaternion using <def>q.axis</def> and <def>q.angle</def>.

        </section>

        <section title="Representing Orientations" id="maths_orientation">

            The difference between a rotation and an orientation is that a rotation is a change in orientation. It is
            like the difference between an absolute value and an offset. In order to use an offset as an absolute value,
            we must assume a base value from which to offset to the value we want. In the case of simple numbers and
            positions, it is clear that the base value should be 0, or vec(0,0,0) respectively. However with rotations,
            one uses the identity quaternion, or quat(1,0,0,0) as a base.

            For models, no rotation at all just means that XYZ in model space point in the same directions as XYZ in
            world space.  However for lights, an unrotated light will shine in the +Y direction. Thus if you want it to
            shine in the -Z direction then it needs to be rotated by the following quaternion:

            <lua>
                quat(vec(0,1,0), vec(0,0,-1))
            </lua>

            Having lights shine in +Y by default is an arbitrary decision.  Other applications instead prefer +Z, -Z,
            etc., so one must be careful when converting lighting setups from other software into Grit.

        </section>

        <section title="Transforming Vectors With Quaternions" id="maths_transform">

            If you have a point (or a direction, in the form of a direction vector) in model space, and you want to
            transform it into world space, you use the orientation of the object to rotate that vector.  For example if
            you want to know if a car is upside down, you can trotate the up vector for the car in model space,
            vec(0,0,1), by the car's orientation, and test if it is still pointing up.

            <lua>
                (car_orientation * vec(0,0,1)).z > 0
            </lua>

            This operation can be chained.  If you have a turret on a tank, and the turret usually faces +Y in model
            space, but you want to know where it points in world space given the turret angle (clockwise from the top)
            and tank orientation, you could use:

            <lua>
                turret_point_model_space = quat(turret_angle, vec(0,0,-1)) * vec(0,1,0)
                turret_point_world_space = tank_orientation * turret_point_model_space
            </lua>

            You can also combine the two quaternions into a single one that describes the complete rotation:

            <lua>
                turret_orientation_world_space = tank_orientation * quat(turret_angle, vec(0,0,-1))
                turret_vector_world_space = turret_orientation_world_space * vec(0,1,0)
            </lua>

            You can also invert a quaternion, which simply is the opposite rotation, i.e. the opposite angle around the
            same axis:

            <lua>
                inv(quat(35, vec(0,1,0))) == quat(-35, vec(0,1,0))
            </lua>

            This allows you to find out e.g. where the turret should point at in model space, in order for it point in a
            particular direction in world space.  From there you can e.g.  use math.atan2 to figure out the angle for
            the turret.

            <lua>
                turret_point_model_space = inv(turret_orientation_world_space) * vector_to_enemy
            </lua>

        mostly useless without the accompanying media tree (the <web url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gritengine/">Game 
        Directory</web> which is available on Sourceforge via Subversion.  Therefore to get everything, execute the following:

        <lua>
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/sparkprime/grit-engine.git grit-engine
        svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/gritengine/code/trunk grit-engine/media
        </lua>

        The subversion tree also contains prebuilt up-to-date executables (Linux &amp; Windows) so the majority
        of developers only need that.  Grit can be substantially modified through Lua scripting, and this
        potential should be exhausted before modifying C++ code.

        Build files are provided for Linux (<code>Makefile</code> and <code>.../*grit.mk</code>) and Visual Studio 2013 project
        files.  Building C++ takes about an hour on Windows and 10 minutes on Linux.  Scripts are available
        for copying new executables into Subversion, if it is checked out in the <code>media/</code> directory.


        <section title="Windows" id="compilation_windows">

                Only Visual Studio Express 2013 is supported. It is free (as in beer). Download it from the
                Microsoft site.

            <section title="Requirements" id="compilation_windows_requirements">
                You will need the DirectX9 SDK (Google it), install that on your system (in <code>Program Files</code>). The
                install adds a system-wide environment variable <code>DXSDK_DIR</code> pointing to the install directory. This
                is used by the Visual Studio build.  If Visual studio is running, you will have to restart it to
                make it 'see' the new environment variable.
            </section>

            <section title="Regular build" id="compilation_windows_building">
                Open grit-engine.sln and build the whole solution with the <italic>Normal</italic> configuration.  This will build
                all the tools and dependencies.
            </section>

            <section title="Debug Build" id="compilation_windows_debugging">
                Debugging with Visual Studio requires the engine to be built with the <italic>Debug</italic> configuration.  To run
                in the debugger, execute the <code>engine</code> project from inside Visual Studio.  You may need to set the
                working directory to the <code>media/</code> directory (from the <code>engine</code> project properties).

            <section title="Modifying the Build" id="compilation_windows_modifying">
                The build uses hand-written MSVC build files.  Each executable and library has a project file, and
                properties files are used to layer additional build options without duplicating them between project
                files.  They are structured as follows:
                <ul>    
                    <li><code>grit-engine.sln</code>: Collects together all the projects.</li>    
                    <li><code>solution.props</code>: Build options for all libraries and executables.  Options that are the
                         same for both Debug and Normal configurations live here.</li>    
                    <li><code>solution_debug.props</code>: Additional options when compiling in debug mode.  Options that are the
                         same for all object files live here.</li>
                    <li><code>solution_normal.props</code>: Additional options when compiling in normal mode.  Options that are
                         the same for all object files live here.</li>    
                    <li><code>pch.props</code>: Options for enabling the precompiled header, used for top-level apps.</li>    
                    <li><code>path/to/my-project/my-project.vcxproj</code>: An executable or library to build.  Build options
                         that are specific to the library itself (like warning levels) live here.</li>
                    <li><code>path/to/my-project/my-project.props</code>: Build options required by clients of a library and the
                         library itself (typically defines and include paths).</li>
               </ul>

        <section title="Linux" id="compilation_linux">

                The following instructions are for Ubuntu.  If you're using another distro, you'll have to figure it
                out for yourself but hopefully the Ubuntu instructions will help.  Note that the make files require
                GNU make, which may be called gmake on your system.

            <section title="Requirements" id="compilation_linux_requirements">

                <lua>
                sudo apt-get install subversion g++ make pkg-config gdb valgrind \

            <section title="Building" id="compilation_linux_building">
                Simply running <code>make -j 8</code> in the root (adjust for your number of cores) will build everything.
                Executables for the current platform are left in the root directory.  You can add it to your PATH.
            </section>

            <section title="Debugging" id="compilation_linux_debugging">
                You can debug Grit with <code>gdb</code> or <code>valgrind</code>.  If the assembly is too obscure, disable
                optimizations by overriding the OPT variable as so:

                <lua>
                make -j 8 OPT=
                </lua>

                Note that this will not rebuild anything that is already built, so you might want to first delete
                specific object files -- the ones containing the code you're debugging, and then rebuilding them
                without optimizations.

            <section title="Modifying the Build" id="compilation_linux_modifying">
                The makefiles are handwritten.  They use a lot of GNU make specific features.  Each sub-project and
                dependency defines a <code>grit.mk</code> file which defines the additional source files and required build
                options.  These are all included by the root <code>Makefile</code> which computes the actual build rules.
